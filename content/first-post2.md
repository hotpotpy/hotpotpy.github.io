Summary: Filler content while I get used to using Pelican.

I went to Starbucks today. I ordered on the mobile app while in campus and walked towards Starbucks. Either I walked too fast, ordered too late, or there were many orders at that time, but when I got to the place, I still had to wait. 

I noticed that the barista was making a frappuccino, and I suspected it was mine. When the barista was pouring the drink into the cup, the cup fell down and the contents spilled on the counter. The barista stopped and paused for a few seconds, probably thinking about what to do (or annoyed that the cup fell down). I saw another employee handling the cashier turn her head and notice the spill. There wasn't much of a reaction from the other person (brief look of a few seconds).

The barista poured the rest into a new cup (call this cup B and the original cup, cup A), and transferred the sticker to cup B. She threw away cup A, took a new cup (cup C), and started making the drink again. While the ice was bring crushed, she took out a cloth and cleaned the spill. The machine finished, and she poured the drink into cup C (no spill this time). She then transferred the sticker from cup B to cup C, and called out the name. I admired the efficient process of the barista in that situation, and thought to write about it in this post. It was my drink, and if I didn't see the accident happen, I wouldn't have known it happened prior to getting my drink.

When I stepped into the classroom today, I decided to sit closer to the back of the room (back meaning farther from the blackboard). The classroom can be described by an x-y axis. The entrance is at left, at y=0. The axis are the paths where you can walk, and the quadrants are filled with seats (so maybe the comparison should have been a window with 4 boxes). 

Describing the classroom was likely a waste of time, but I need filler content for this post. 

The class size is supposed to be about 90, but I didn't feel like there were actually 90 students. For this particular class, the professor has attendance count as 20% of the grade. The professor passed out two attendance sheets for students to fill out. The sheets are filled out with students names already, so all that's left is to sign next to your name. It looks easy for people to sign for other people (some people printed their name). I sat in the back, but I didn't see too many people sign the sheet. Maybe most people used the other sheet (I wouldn't know).

I have been sidetracked too much. The point of this post was actually to comment that I observed the classmate next to me flipping through a Korean language textbook/workbook. She had two such books, and was going through the pages and doing the exercises. The person occasionally looked up at the professor and the projected screen behind him, but was mostly learning/studying Korean (with light phone usage here and there). Most people were on their laptops or phones. People were in class, but for the most part, their hearts were not in class.
